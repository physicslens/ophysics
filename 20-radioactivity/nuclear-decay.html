        </ol>
   
        <p><strong>Radioactive decay</strong> is the <strong>spontaneous</strong> and <strong>random</strong> emission of radiation from a radioactive source when an unstable nucleus disintegrates to acquire a more stable state. . The three main types of radiation are alpha (α), beta (β), and gamma (γ) rays. They consist of α-particles, β-particles and high frequency electromagnetic photons respectively.</p>
        
            <p>- spontaneous means the process is unaffected by any external factors, such as temperature or pressure. And the process is unaffected by chemical reaction.</p>
            <p>- random emission means it is impossible to predict which nucleus will decay next, but each has the same constant probability of decay per unit time. The probability of decay follows the laws of statistics.</p>

        
        <p>Radioactive decays can be expressed in the form of equations typically indicating the initial radioactive substance, the resulting decay products, and the specific type of emitted particles or radiation involved in the process. The <strong>conservation of nucleons</strong> in a radioactive decay equation is a fundamental principle in nuclear physics that states that the total number of nucleons (protons and neutrons) remains constant before and after a radioactive decay event. In other words, the sum of protons and neutrons in the parent nucleus is equal to the sum of protons and neutrons in the daughter nuclei and any emitted particles (such as alpha or beta particles). This conservation principle ensures that the total mass and charge within a nuclear reaction remains constant, preserving fundamental properties of the nucleus during radioactive decay processes, even though individual protons and neutrons may change their states or positions within the nucleus.</p>
        
        <h3>20.2.1 Alpha Decay</h3>
        <p>An alpha decay is the process by which a nucleus emits an alpha (α) particle. An α-particle is a doubly positively charged helium nucleus consisting of 2 protons and 2 neutrons ($^4_2\text{He}^{2+}$). It is emitted with discrete energy. This emission results in a new atom with a mass number smaller by 4 and an atomic number smaller by 2 than the original atom.</p>
        <p>The general equation for alpha decays can be represented by:$$^A_Z\text{X}\rightarrow{}^{A-4}_{Z-2}\text{Y}+^4_2\text{He}$$</p>
        <p>For example,$$^{226}_{88}\text{Ra}\rightarrow{}^{222}_{86}\text{Rn}+^4_2\text{He}$$</p>
        
        <h3>20.2.2 Beta Decay</h3>
        <p>A begta decay is the process by which a nucleus emits a beta (β) particle. A β-particle is a high speed electron originating from the nucleus through nuclear transformation in which a neutron changes into a proton and an electron.
            $$^1_0\text{n}\rightarrow{}^1_1\text{p}+^0_{-1}\text{e}$$ 
            
            It occurs for nuclides with too high a neutron–proton ratio.</p>
        <p>This emission does not change the nucleon number of the parent nuclide. So the new atom has the same mass number but an atomic number that is larger by 1. The general equation for beta decays can be represented by:$$^A_Z\text{X}\rightarrow{}^{A}_{Z+1}\text{Y}+^0_{-1}\text{e}$$</p>
        <p>For example,$$^{214}_{82}\text{Pb}\rightarrow{}^{214}_{83}\text{Bi}+^0_{-1}\text{e}$$</p>
        
        <h3>20.2.3 Gamma Decay</h3>
        <p>A gamma decay is the process by which a nucleus emits a gamma (γ) particle. A γ-particle is a high frequency electromagnetic photon of discrete energy spectrum. It is emitted when a radioactive nuclide in its excited state (denoted by *) returns to ground state. It often follows another decay process such as alpha or beta emission which has left the daughter nucleus in an excited state. This emission does not result in any change in nuclear structure
.
            $$^A_X\text{X}^*\rightarrow{}^A_Z\text{X}+\gamma$$ 
            
        For example, a beta decay can leave a nuclide in its nuclide state
            $$^{24}_{11}\text{Na}\rightarrow{}^{24}_{12}\text{Mg*}+^0_{-1}\text{e}$$
   which is followed by the gamma decay $$^{24}_{12}\text{Mg}^*\rightarrow{}^{24}_{12}\text{Mg}+\gamma$$</p>

        <h3>20.2.4 Measuring Radioactivity</h3>
       
        <p>Radioactivity is measured experimentally using radiation detectors such as Geiger-Muller tubes. The process involves placing the radioactive source near the detector, allowing the radiation (alpha, beta or gamma particles) to ionize the molecules of the detector material. This process involves knocking electrons out of their atomic orbits, creating pairs of positively charged ions and free electrons. These free electrons are then attracted to the positively charged anode in the detector, creating an electrical current or pulse that can be measured. These electrical signals are then converted into counts or a measurable output.</p>

        <p><strong>Background radiation</strong>, due to naturally occurring radiation in the environment, is often subtracted from the measurements to isolate the radiation emitted by the radioactive source. The resulting data can be used to calculate the activity of the source or assess radiation exposure levels, crucial for various applications in fields like nuclear physics, healthcare, and radiation protection.</p>
        
        
        <p><strong>Half-life</strong> is the time taken for half of the radioactive atoms in a sample to undergo radioactive decay. This time interval is characteristic of each radioactive isotope and remains constant for that isotope. During one half-life, half of the radioactive material decays, emitting radiation or particles, while the other half remains unchanged. The concept of half-life is crucial for understanding the rate of decay and predicting how much radioactive material will remain over time.</p>
        
        <p>The graph in the applet below shows how the amount of radioactive atoms changes in a sample with time. By moving the first slider, you can see how the decay curve reduces by half the value after each half-life. By moving the second slider, you can see how the curve changes with the value of half-life.</p>
