        <h3>Energy and Power</h3>
        
        <p>Recall the definitions of energy and power in Topic 05.</p>
        
        <p>Electrical power $P$ is given by</p>
        
        $$P = IV$$
        
        <p align="center">where $P$ is the electrical power (unit: watt, W), <br>$I$ is electric current (unit: ampere, A), and<br>$V$ is the potential difference (unit: volt, V)</p>
        
        <p>The rate of energy converted from electrical energy to other forms as a 2.0 A current passes through a device experiencing a potential difference of 3.0 V is, therefore, 6.0 W or 6.0 J per second.</p>
        
        <p>Substituting the relationship $V = IR$ or $I =\dfrac{V}{R}$ into the equation, we can obtain the alternative equations $$P = I^2R$$ and $$P = \dfrac{V^2}{R}$$ respectively. Any of these 3 equations can be used to calculate electrical power, and the choice on which to use depends or whether current or potential difference gets to be constant.</p>

            <li>In series, the light bulb with the larger resistance shines brigher. Since current is the same through both bulbs, we can compare the power output by referrring to the ratio of power using the equation $P = I^2R$.</li>$$\dfrac{P_A}{P_B}=\dfrac{I_A^2R_A}{I_B^2R_B} = \dfrac{R_A}{R_B} = \dfrac{2}{4} = 0.5$$ In fact, bulb B has twice the power of bulb A.
            <li>in parallel, it is the bulb with smaller resistance that is brighter. Since potential difference is constant, e can show this using the equation $P = \dfrac{V^2}{R}$. $$\dfrac{P_A}{P_B}=\dfrac{\frac{V_A^2}{R_A}}{\frac{V_B^2}{R_B}} \ $$</li></ol></div>

        <h3>Newton's Second Law of Motion</h3>
        
        <blockquote>The resultant force acting on an object of a constant mass is the product of the mass and acceleration of the object. The object accelerates in the direction of the resultant force.</blockquote>
        
        <p>For a body of constant mass, $$F_{net} = ma$$</p>
        <p align="center">where $F_{net}$ is the resultant or net force (unit: N),<br>$m$ is the mass (unit: kg), and<br>$a$ is the acceeleration (unit: m s<sup>-2</sup>)</p>
        
        <p>If the resultant force is zero, (all forces are balanced), then acceleration is zero. The object is either at rest or moving at constant velocity. Hence, the first law of motion is a special case of the second law. When resultant force is not zero, this means that forces acting on the body are unbalanced.</p>
        
        <p>There will be many examples for practice in the next page. For now, let's try something simple.</p>

        <table width="100%"><tr><td>
            <p>The mass of a lift is 2000 kg. When the tension in the supporting cable is 28 000 N, its acceleration is:</p>

            B. 4.2 m s<sup>-2</sup> downwards<br>

            <div id="ans2" style="display:none">
                <p>A. 4.2 m s<sup>-2</sup> upwards</p>
                    $$\begin{aligned}
                    W &= 2000 \times 9.81 \\
                    &= 19 600 N\\
                    \end{aligned}$$
                                     
                    Since T > W, the net force and acceleration are upward. We will express the net force as the difference between T and W. Ensure that the difference is positive (i.e. take T - W instead of W - T),  as acceleration is taken to be positive.

                    $$\begin{aligned}
                    F_{net} &= ma \\
                    T - W &= ma \\
                    28000 - 19600 &= (2000)a\\
                    a &= 4.2 m s^{-2}\\

        <h3>Newton's Third Law of Motion</h3>
        
        <blockquote>If body A exerts a force on body B, then body B exerts an equal and opposite force on body A.</blockquote>
        
        <p>The forces mentioned in the Third Law are known as action-reaction pairs and they must fulfill these 3 criteria:</p>
        <ol><li>be of the same type (i.e. a gravitational force and an electric force cannot constitute an action-reaction pair)</li>
        <li>act on different bodies</li>
        <li>be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction</li></ol>
        <p>Some examples of action-reaction pairs:</p>
<ol><li>The gravitational forces of attraction between the Earth and the Moon.</li>
<li>Electric forces of attraction between an electron and a proton.</li>
<li>The normal contact force exerted by a table on a book resting on it and the normal contact force exerted by the book on the table.</li>
